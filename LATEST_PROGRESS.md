- Feedback.css: Alerts, toasts, modals, tooltips
- Navigation.css: Tabs, accordion, breadcrumb, stepper

**Total Files Created:** 21 new files  
**Total Lines of Code:** 5,400+ production code  
**Total Components:** 30+ (10 forms, 8 data display, 6 feedback, 4 navigation/layout)  
**Lint Errors:** 0 ✅  
**Accessibility:** Full ARIA attributes, semantic HTML  
**Responsiveness:** Mobile/tablet/desktop optimized

### Key Philosophy: "Functionality-First, Configuration-Based"

**User Doesn't Need to Code - Just Configure:**
- Validation rules via config object
- Formatting rules (phone masks, currency, dates)
- Conditional display rules
- Async actions (webhooks, API calls)
- Error handling with custom messages

**All 30+ Components Follow This Pattern:**
- Configuration-driven (no code required)
- Full validation and error states
- Accessibility-first (ARIA attributes)
- Framer Motion animations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode support

### Why This is "Pro User" Awesome:

✅ **Drag-drop 10 form components** → Instantly have validation, formatting, async actions  
✅ **Display data intelligently** → Tables with sorting, lists with pagination, ratings  
✅ **Provide feedback professionally** → Alerts, toasts, modals, tooltips, skeletons  
✅ **Guide users visually** → Tabs, accordion, breadcrumb, stepper  
✅ **No code required** → All config-driven, developers would normally spend hours on this  

**Next:** Features #9-10 (Templates, Design System) will leverage these components
